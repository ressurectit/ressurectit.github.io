# Angular Grid

Angular Grid. Fully modular grid component, which allows changing parts of grid with predefined implementations or custom implementations. Main aim of this grid was to create *lightweight* component with little features as possible built-in, but with possibility to create parts that can do anything you want, even with complex or completely custom requirements.

Grid is used for displaying *lists*, that means it does not have to be table layout, but completely custom layout.
