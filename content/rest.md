# Angular Rest

Angular Rest client built on top of `HttpClient` from `@angular/common/http` module. With this module you can build *Angular* services that will use `HttpClient` on background. You will create methods and *decorate* them with *decorators* from this module. It is similar to *Java Sping* REST API definition. All REST services are defined in *declarative* way.
